  - SCIENTIST: Restricted from modifying staff, vehicle, or equipment data.  

- **Services**:  
  - **Field Service**: Manages fields allocated for cultivation.  
  - **Crop Service**: Handles crop types and growth stages.  
  - **Staff Service**: Manages staff assignments and resources.  
  - **Vehicle Service**: Oversees vehicle management and allocations.  
  - **Equipment Service**: Tracks and manages agricultural equipment.  
  - **Log Monitoring Service**: Records and tracks crop-related observations.  
  - **Authentication Service**: Handles secure user authentication using Spring Security and OAuth 2.0.  

- **Analysis**:  
  - Relational analysis of resources like labor and vehicle assignments.  
  - Spatial and temporal analysis for enhanced decision-making.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML, CSS, CSS Frameworks, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX  

- **Backend**:  
  - Spring Boot  
  - Spring Data, Spring Web MVC, Spring Validation, Spring Security  
  - Lombok, Model Mapper, Jackson  
  - JWT Authentication  
  - MySQL  

## System Design  
- **Three-Layer Architecture**:  
  1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.  
  2. **Service Layer**: Implements business logic.  
  3. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage using JPA with MySQL.
